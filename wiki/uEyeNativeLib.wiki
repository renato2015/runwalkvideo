#summary Some thoughts on extending the ueye-nativelib shared library for integrating uEye camera'z
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Some proposals to improve ueye-nativelib =

 * Create a full screen window from JAVA code
 * If a handle is present, try to start a message pump without creating a window
 
 * Try to use Direct3D from the native code using the handle created on the java side (not applicable anymore)
 * Will need to try STEAL_MODE for recording using D3D & AVI tools library
 * Analyse this solution with respect to a possible performance penalty
 
= Details =

 * Retrieve the GraphicsDevice instance for a current monitor
 * Create a new Frame and set it using setFullScreenWindow()
 * Get the native handle (HWND) for that Canvas using the Native JNA class
 * Add a parameter to startRunning() accepting a HWND handle
 * At native side, check if parameter is present
 * If present, try to render in Direct3D => impossible due to exclusivity of this mode to other rendering windows
 * If not present, proceed with code as it is now (creating a new window)
